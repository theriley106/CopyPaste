# Card_Replicator
Utility to Replicate Standard 3.375 Ã— 2.125 inch PVC Cards using a Canon TS9120


## Process

### Step 1

A card is placed onto the scanner in any orientation.  Using scanline we can save the results from the flatbed scanner to as a JPEG.

  <img src="static/1.png" width="500px"/>
</p>


### Step 2

We remove the background to make the image transparent, and apply a mask to remove noise that may be present from the scan.

<p>
  <img src="static/2.png" width="500px"/>
</p>

We deskew the image to ensure the card is not slanting too far in one direction.
