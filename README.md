## Process

### Step 1

A card is placed onto the scanner in any orientation.  Using scanline we can save the results from the flatbed scanner as a JPEG.

### Step 2

We remove the background to make the image transparent, and apply a mask to remove noise that may be present from the scan.

</p>

### Step 3

We use the "Unrotate" script created by Fred Weinhaus to rotate the card.  This tool accurately fixes images where the card is rotated more than 5 degrees.

</p>

### Step 4

We once again apply a filter to more accurately remove the background from the image.

</p>

### Step 5

We deskew the image to ensure the card is not slanting too far in one direction.  Deskew generally fixes cases where the card is rotated ~5 degrees and it adds an extra level of presision when fixing unwanted slanting in the image produced by Unrotate.

</p>

### Step 6

Tesseract is used to do optical character recognition on the scanned image.  The image is rotated and a score is assigned based on the results from tesseract to determine the correct orientation of the card.

In this example the card is rotated 180 degrees.

### Step 7

A template is created to print the scanned card with a [Canon M Tray](https://brainstormidsupply.com/pvc-card-tray-for-canon-m-tray-printers-ts80xx-ts81xx-ts90xx-ts91xx.html).
